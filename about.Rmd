### Experience

I have spent the past four years working with the Northern Sierra Partnership (NSP), a collaborative initiative comprising five conservation organizations. As the Deputy Campaign Director, I have helped coordinate NSP’s joint fundraising campaigns and supported the protection and stewardship of the region north of Lake Tahoe. Prior to joining the Partnership, I graduated from Stanford University (2014) with a B.S. in Earth Systems. During my undergraduate career, I focused my coursework on environmental policy and co-authored a paper titled “All Over the Map: The Diversity of Western Water Plans,” which was published in the California Journal of Politics and Policy. After graduation, I served as an AmeriCorps Volunteer with Sequoia Riverlands Trust in Visalia, CA. There, I was introduced to the conservation field and became interested in the ways land protection and restoration can serve as climate adaption strategies. 

### Skills and Interests
I aim to center the next chapter of my career on advancing climate solutions. To that end, I am refocusing on clean energy and climate policy in my graduate studies at Bren, specializing in Energy and Climate with a focus on Environmental Communication. I aim to build my technical skill set and have become increasingly interested in data analysis and visualization.
