The report explores the relationships among a subset of those variables, including country elevation, cropland cover, tree canopy cover, average annual rainfall and temperature, wind and cloudiness, using principal components analysis. The results are visualized in a biplot and interpreted in a brief summary.\n2.

Vectors indicate loadings of variables along each principal component. Data: Venter, 2018\n\n\n\nSummary\nMajor takeaways from the PCA include:\nTree canopy cover and average annual rainfall are positively correlated.\nCropland cover and elevation are positively correlated.\nCropland cover and average annual temperature are negatively correlated.\nWind and tree canopy cover are negatively correlated.\nCloudiness and cropland cover are minimally correlated.\nThere are no observable clusters of observations and only a couple of outliers.\nCloudiness, tree canopy cover, and average annual rainfall are heavily loaded in the direction of the first principal component.\nAverage annual temperature and cropland cover are heavily loaded in the direction of the second principal component.\nOver 60% of total variance is represented.\n\n\n\n",
