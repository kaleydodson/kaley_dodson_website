      "contents": "\nExperience\nI have spent the past four years working with the Northern Sierra Partnership (NSP), a collaborative initiative comprising five conservation organizations. As the Deputy Campaign Director, I have helped coordinate NSP’s joint fundraising campaigns and supported the protection and stewardship of the region north of Lake Tahoe. Prior to joining the Partnership, I graduated from Stanford University (2014) with a B.S. in Earth Systems. During my undergraduate career, I focused my coursework on environmental policy and co-authored a paper titled “All Over the Map: The Diversity of Western Water Plans,” which was published in the California Journal of Politics and Policy. After graduation, I served as an AmeriCorps Volunteer with Sequoia Riverlands Trust in Visalia, CA. There, I was introduced to the conservation field and became interested in the connection between land protection and management and water resources.\nSkills and Interests\nAt Bren, I aim to build my technical skill set and train for a career centered on protecting and managing natural resources.\n\n\n\n",
