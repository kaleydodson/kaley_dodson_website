      "contents": "\nExperience\nI have spent the past four years working with the Northern Sierra Partnership (NSP), a collaborative initiative comprising five conservation organizations. As the Deputy Campaign Director, I have helped coordinate NSP’s joint fundraising campaigns and supported the protection and stewardship of the region north of Lake Tahoe. Prior to joining the Partnership, I graduated from Stanford University (2014) with a B.S. in Earth Systems. During my undergraduate career, I focused my coursework on environmental policy and co-authored a paper titled “All Over the Map: The Diversity of Western Water Plans,” which was published in the California Journal of Politics and Policy. After graduation, I served as an AmeriCorps Volunteer with Sequoia Riverlands Trust in Visalia, CA. There, I was introduced to the conservation field and became interested in the ways land protection and restoration can serve as climate adaption strategies.\nSkills and Interests\nI aim to center the next chapter of my career on advancing climate solutions. To that end, I am refocusing on clean energy and climate policy in my graduate studies at Bren, specializing in Energy and Climate with a focus on Environmental Communication. I aim to build my technical skill set and have become increasingly interested in data analysis and visualization.\n\n\n\n",
